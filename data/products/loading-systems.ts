<h2><strong>Stepped dock: increased efficiency and safety</strong></h2>

<p>With its specialized design, the stepped dock provides a safe and efficient solution for the loading and unloading process. This unique design allows trucks to dock while their doors remain closed.</p>

<p>The truck must first dock in the correct position, after which the dock shelter seals the loading bay before the overhead door is opened. The final step here is to open the rear doors of the truck. This is possible thanks to the cut-outs on both sides of the dock leveller.</p>

<h3><strong>Advantages of our stepped dock</strong></h3>

<p>There are several advantages to docking with closed doors, including:</p>

<ul class="icon icon-ok long-ul"><li>Increased efficiency</li>
	<li>Increased safety</li>
	<li>Energy-saving</li>
	<li>Theft prevention</li>
	<li>Suitable for situations with a slope</li>
	<li>Docking with closed doors</li>
</ul><!--- BODY 1 - End--><!--- BODY 2 - Begin --><h2><strong>Seamless integration into any building with our stepdock</strong></h2>

<p>The stepped dock is a telescopic lip dock leveller with a self-supporting frame for easy integration into any building. It is the perfect solution for hygienic transport and food logistics requiring an uninterrupted cold chain and even for locations with an increased risk of theft.</p>

<h3><strong>Features of the stepped dock</strong></h3>

</div>

<div class="col-sm-9">
<p><strong>Easy operation</strong></p>

<p>The stepped dock control box contains an additional button that, when pressed, causes the valve to extend from its resting position and then lower to its lowest position. This allows the user to safely open the truck doors because the gap is covered. In addition, the control box is very efficient in use as the overhead door, dock leveller and dock shelter can be operated through one control.</p>

<div class="col-sm-9">
<p><strong>Temperature maintenance</strong></p>

<p>By allowing trucks to dock with closed doors, the stepdock helps to minimize heat loss and makes it easier to regulate the temperature inside. This not only results in energy savings but also ensures better hygiene and working conditions.</p>

<p><strong>High or low rest position</strong></p>

<p>When implementing a dock leveller with stepped dock functionality, it is necessary to choose between a high or low rest position. Opting for a dock leveller with a high rest position offers several benefits. Firstly, it can be easily included in the shop floor and can be driven over when the leveller is switched off. Moreover, the high rest position eliminates tripping hazards, thus improving overall safety.</p>

<h2><b>Variants of stepdock</b></h2>

<p>The Loading Systems stepped dock is available in various configurations.</p>

<div class="accordion panel panel-default">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h3 class="accordion">ISO stepped dock</h3>

<p class="accordion">… for situations requiring extra insulation</p>
</div>

<div class="panel-body collapse">
<p>For situations where temperature maintenance is crucial, an ISO stepped dock solution can be chosen. This leaves extra space in the pit to allow the overhead door to close in front of the dock leveller, instead of on top of it.</p>

<p>This extra space between the leveller and door is the safety zone. This does create a hazardous area as there is a gap between the leveller and truck. Therefore, the ISO stepdock is equipped with an extra safety option as standard to bridge the safety zone.</p>

<p>In combination with the inflatable dock shelter, especially as part of the integrated sequence control with the control box, this system is perfect for reducing energy costs and increasing loading efficiency.</p>

<h2><strong>Accessories for the stepped dock</strong></h2>

<p>Accessories have been developed for a stepped dock which can be ordered separately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="icon icon-ok long-ul"><li><strong>Stepped dock bumpers</strong></li>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 43px">Our recommended solution for a stepped ISO dock and a stepped dock house includes bumpers that can be easily pushed down with the foot to open the truck doors upon docking. Once the truck departs, these bumpers automatically slide back up by pressing a pin with the foot, making it a convenient and user-friendly option.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="icon icon-ok long-ul"><li><strong>Stepped dock handrails</strong></li>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 43px">A set of guardrails placed on either side of the stepped ISO dock to protect the steps and prevent accidents while securing the truck doors.
